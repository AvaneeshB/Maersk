Problem Statement
-----------------

Create a project in java to

1. Write java program to :
    a. Scan 'input' directory and merge the files which are having similar column structure 
    c. Lets assume input directory has 4 files out of which
        eg. file1 has 2 columns named as ( 'username', 'password') and file3 also have same columns ('username', 'password')
        so here you will join both of these files and create a new file. 
        Same goes for other file.
    c. Save the file
       eg. if you are merging file1 and file2 then output filename should be -> file1-file2.xlsx (follow the same steps for other files also)
